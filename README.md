# Sign Language Recognition Project
Sign Language Recognition project using Machine Learning and MediaPipe for real-time hand gesture detection.

# Description
This project recognizes hand gestures from Sign Language using **MediaPipe** for real-time hand tracking and **Machine Learning** for gesture classification.  
The goal is to assist communication for people with hearing and speech impairments by providing an AI-based recognition system.

## Features
- Real-time hand detection using MediaPipe.
- Machine Learning model for classifying different gestures.
- Easy to run and extend for more gestures.
- Lightweight and works on most laptops.

## Dataset
- Collected custom dataset of hand gestures (images/coordinates).
- Each gesture labeled and used to train the ML model.
